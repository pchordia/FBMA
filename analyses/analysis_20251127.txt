*/Facebook Ads Analysis - 20251127
================================================================================

Looking at yesterday's data, here's what jumped out over my morning coffee:

## Overall Performance - Mixed Signals

We spent $1,866 across 61 active ads and generated trials at a blended CPT around $21-25 (eyeballing the conversion costs). That's actually not terrible for this vertical, but I'm seeing some concerning patterns in how that spend is distributed.

The big picture concern? We're spreading budget way too thin. Over half our ads spent less than $10, which means we're basically burning money on statistical noise. Meanwhile, our few meaningful spenders are showing wildly different performance levels.

## What's Working - Three Clear Winners

**"06 fbg og - Copy"** ($229 spend) is our star performer with a $8.49 CPT and strong engagement metrics. This female avatar creative is absolutely crushing it - 2.5% CTR, solid video completion rates, and converting at nearly 3x better than our worst performers.

**"jesus_rap_1_4x5"** ($159 spend) is also solid at $39.73 CPT. The engagement is there (8,800+ page engagements) and it's scaling well with good quality rankings.

**"07 black_4"** ($203 spend) deserves attention - $10.14 CPT with 3 actual purchases. This female avatar is not just driving trials but converting to paid users.

The pattern? **Female avatars are significantly outperforming male ones.** All three winners feature women, while our male-heavy rap content is struggling.

## What's Not Working - Budget Bleeders

**"11 black baby - Copy"** burned $59 for a single trial ($58.66 CPT). That's painful, especially since the original "11 black baby" performed much better at $16.48 CPT with meaningful spend.

**Jesus_rap_1_4x5** in the StartTrial campaign spent $123 for 16 trials ($7.70 CPT) - which actually looks decent until you realize the install campaign version of the same creative is doing $39 CPT. Something's broken in that funnel.

Most concerning: We have 30+ ads that spent under $5 each. That's just Facebook learning tax with zero signal.

## Notable Changes & Red Flags

**Campaign Fragmentation:** We're running the same creatives across multiple campaigns (Install vs Purchase vs StartTrial) with dramatically different results. "tyson_rap_2_4x5" has a $30.73 CPT in install but $26.65 CPT in purchase campaign - why are we not consolidating budget to the winner?

**New Creative Testing:** The "rap_set2" creatives launched yesterday are mostly spending pocket change ($1-15 each). "02 Eddie_Snoop" looks promising at $111 spend but needs more volume to confirm the $36.94 CPT.

**Delivery Issues:** Too many ads stuck in "Unknown" ranking, suggesting audience overlap or creative fatigue.

## Questions & Hypotheses Worth Digging Into

1. **Why are female avatars dramatically outperforming male ones?** This could be a fundamental insight about our target demo that should reshape our entire creative strategy.

2. **What's causing the massive CPT variance between campaigns for identical creatives?** We need to audit our campaign setups - audiences, bidding, or optimization events might be misaligned.

3. **Should we kill the rap theme entirely?** The male rap avatars are consistently underperforming. Maybe our audience wants different content themes.

4. **Can we scale the winners harder?** "06 fbg og - Copy" at $8.49 CPT should be getting 5x more budget than it currently is.

**Immediate Actions:** Pause everything under $50 spend, consolidate winning creatives into single campaigns, and triple the budget on female avatar ads. We're leaving money on the table by not feeding our winners.
